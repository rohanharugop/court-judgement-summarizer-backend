      "The query \"procedure established by law under Article 21\" pertains to the constitutional interpretation of the phrase \"procedure established by law\" in the context of the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment in **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (2017)** is relevant as it elucidates that the expression \"procedure established by law\" in Article 21 signifies a procedure that is not only present in enacted law but also fair, just, and reasonable (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors., 2017). This interpretation highlights the substantive aspect of the procedure, emphasizing that it must be of a certain quality to meet the constitutional mandate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment in **Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India (1978)** is also pertinent as it reiterates that the procedure prescribed by law must be fair, just, and reasonable, and not arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive (Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India, 1978). This case underscores the importance of the procedure being reasonable and not merely a formalistic requirement, aligning with the interpretation provided in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (2017)** is relevant as it notes that a law depriving a person of personal liberty, as per Article 21, must also stand the test of fundamental rights conferred under Article 19, indicating an overlap between these rights (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors., 2017). This highlights the interconnectedness of fundamental rights and the necessity for any procedure established by law to be scrutinized against the backdrop of these rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, **Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India (1978)** is relevant as it discusses the reasonableness of the procedure in the context of Article 21, emphasizing that the assessment of reasonableness should not be based on abstract or hypothetical considerations (Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India, 1978). This underscores the practical application of the principle that the procedure established by law must be reasonable and just.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (2017)** is relevant as it construes Article 21 in conjunction with Article 19, recognizing that both sets of rights overlap and that any law affecting personal freedoms under Article 19 must meet the requirements of both articles (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors., 2017). This interpretation is crucial for understanding the breadth and depth of the protection afforded by Article 21 in relation to the procedure established by law.\n",
      "The query \"procedure established by law under Article 21\" pertains to the constitutional interpretation of the phrase \"procedure established by law\" in the context of the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment in **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors.

Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors., 2017). This interpretation emphasizes the quality of the procedure, highlighting that mere presence of a procedure in law is insufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment in **Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India (1978)** is also pertinent as it reiterates that the procedure prescribed by law must be fair, just, and reasonable, and not arbitrary or oppressive (Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India, 1978). This case underscores the importance of the procedure being reasonable and not merely formalistic, aligning with the principle that the deprivation of personal liberty must adhere to stringent standards of fairness and justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (2017)** is relevant as it discusses the inter-relationship between Article 21 and other fundamental rights, particularly those under Article 19, emphasizing that a law affecting personal freedoms must meet the requirements of both articles (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors., 2017). This highlights the comprehensive approach to constitutional interpretation, where the protection of personal liberty is considered in conjunction with other fundamental rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, **Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India (1978)** is relevant as it addresses the consideration of reasonableness of the procedure in the context of Article 21, emphasizing that such consideration must be based on concrete circumstances rather than abstract or hypothetical scenarios (Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India, 1978). This judgment provides insight into the practical application of the principle that the procedure established by law must be reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the judgments in **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (2017)** and **Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India (1978)** are crucial in understanding the legal principles surrounding the \"procedure established by law\" under Article 21, emphasizing the requirements of fairness, reasonableness, and non-arbitrariness in procedures that affect the right to life and personal liberty.\n"
