The rules provided for modalities of surveillance.\nJustice O Chinnappa Reddy speaking for a Bench of two judges of this Court\nrecognised the need for surveillance on habitual and potential offenders. In his view:\n“Prevention of crime is one of the prime purposes of the constitution of a police force.\nThe preamble to the Police Act, 1861 says:\n“Whereas it is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a more efficient\ninstrument for the prevention and detection of crime.” Section 23 of the Police Act\nprescribes it as the duty of police officers “to collect and communicate intelligence\naffecting the public peace; to prevent the commission of offences and public\nnuisances”. In connection with these duties it will be necessary to keep discreet\nsurveillance over reputed bad characters, habitual offenders and other potential\noffenders.

Hence, our understanding of the “right to privacy” should account for its\nintersection with Article 20(3).

The criticism is set out thus:\n“There are several sceptical and critical accounts of privacy. According to one well\nknown argument there is no right to privacy and there is nothing special about\nprivacy, because any interest protected as private can be equally well explained and\nprotected by other interests or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily\nsecurity (Thomson, 1975). Other critiques argue that privacy interests are not\ndistinctive because the personal interests they protect are economically inefficient\n(Posner, 1981) or that they are not grounded in any adequate legal doctrine (Bork,\n1990). Finally, there is the feminist critique of privacy, that granting special status",

Privacy, as she\nnotes, has been cast as “old-fashioned at best and downright harmful at worst - anti-progressive,\noverly costly, and inimical to the welfare of the body politic”303. The consequences in her view are\npredictable:\n“…when privacy and its purportedly outdated values must be balanced against the\ncutting-edge imperatives of national security, efficiency, and entrepreneurship,\nprivacy comes up the loser.

Such division of power is believed to be\nconducive to preserving the liberties of the people of India. The very purpose of creating a written\nConstitution is to secure justice, liberty and equality to the people of India. Framers of the\nConstitution believed that certain freedoms are essential to enjoy the fruits of liberty and that the\nState shall not be permitted to trample upon those freedoms except for achieving certain important\nand specified objectives in the larger interests of society. Therefore, the authority of the State for\nmaking a law inconsistent with fundamental rights, is cabined within constitutionally proclaimed\nlimitations.",

The Supreme Court of the United States sustained a claim of a privacy interest on the\ntheory that the Constitution itself creates certain zones of privacy - ‘repose’ and ‘intimate decision.52\nBuilding on this framework, Bostwick53 suggested that there are in fact, three aspects of privacy –\n“repose”, “sanctuary” and “intimate decision”. “Repose” refers to freedom from unwarranted\nstimuli, “sanctuary” to protection against intrusive observation, and “intimate decision” to\nautonomy with respect to the most personal life choices. Whether any other facet of the right of\nprivacy exists cannot be divined now. In my opinion, there is no need to resolve all definitional",

The question of whether Article 21 encompasses a fundamental right to privacy did not fall for\nconsideration before the 8 Judges in the M.P. Sharma Court. Rather, the question was whether an\nimproper search and seizure operation undertaken against a company and its directors would\nviolate the constitutional bar against testimonial compulsion contained in Article 20(3) of the\nConstitution. This Court held that such a search did not violate Article 20(3). Its reasoning\nproceeded on the footing that the absence of a fundamental right to privacy analogous to the Fourth\nAmendment to the United States’ constitution in our own constitution suggested that the\nConstituent Assembly chose not to subject laws providing for search and seizure to constitutional\nlimitations.

The right to be in this condition has been described as\n‘the right to be let alone’25.

The relationship between the\nright of privacy and the particular fundamental right (or rights) involved would depend on the\naction interdicted by a particular law. At a minimum, since privacy is always integrated with\npersonal liberty, the constitutionality of the law which is alleged to have invaded into a rights\nbearer’s privacy must be tested by the same standards by which a law which invades personal liberty\nunder Article 21 is liable to be tested.

Preventive\ndetention, which is dealt with in article 22, also amounts to deprivation of personal\nliberty which is referred to in article 21, and is a violation of the right of freedom of\nmovement dealt with in article 19(1)(d).

The right to privacy may have different aspects starting from ‘the right to be let alone’ in the\nfamous article by Samuel Warren and Louis D. Brandeis 2 . One such aspect is an individual’s right\nto control dissemination of his personal information.

The fate of cases,\nand thereby of legislation, will turn on whether the meaning of the document is\nderived from itself or from one's conception of the country, its development, its\nneeds, its place in a civilized society.” (See Mr Justice Holmes edited by Felix\nFrankfurter, p. 58).

The sexual orientation even within the four walls of the house thus became an aspect\nof debate. I am in agreement with the view of Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J., who in paragraphs 123 &\n124 of his judgment, states that the right of privacy cannot be denied, even if there is a miniscule\nfraction of the population which is affected. The majoritarian concept does not apply to\nConstitutional rights and the Courts are often called up on to take what may be categorized as a\nnon-majoritarian view, in the check and balance of power envisaged under the Constitution of India.\nOnes sexual orientation is undoubtedly an attribute of privacy.

Is freedom of profession done to death if a professional, by\npassport refusal without reference to Art. 19 (f ), is inhibited from taking up a job offered abroad ? is\nfreedom of association such a hot-house plant that membership of an international professional or\npolitical Organisation can be cut off on executive-legislative ipse dixit without obedience to Art.\n19(4) ?",

It cannot be over\nemphasized that when it comes to democracy, liberty of thought and expression is a cardinal value\nthat is of paramount significance under our constitutional scheme.\n9. Various judgments of this Court have referred to the importance of freedom of speech and\nexpression both from the point of view of the liberty of the individual and from the point of view of\nour democratic form of government. For example, in the early case of Romesh Thappar v. State of\nMadras, [1950] S.C.R. 594 at 602, this Court stated that freedom of speech lay at the foundation of\nall democratic organizations.

As this Court has explained,\na regulation is not vague because it may at times be difficult to prove an\nincriminating fact but rather because it is unclear as to what fact must be proved. See\nid., at 306.\nEven when speech is not at issue, the void for vagueness doctrine addresses at least two connected\nbut discrete due process concerns: first, that regulated parties should know what is required of them\nso they may act accordingly; second, precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing\nthe law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S.\n104, 108-109 (1972).

Whereas, in Section\n268 the various expressions used are ingredients for the offence of a public nuisance, these\ningredients now become offences in themselves when it comes to Section 66A. Further, under\nSection 268, the person should be guilty of an act or omission which is illegal in nature - legal acts\nare not within its net. A further ingredient is that injury, danger or annoyance must be to the public\nin general. Injury, danger or annoyance are not offences by themselves howsoever made and to\nwhomsoever made. The expression \"annoyance\" appears also in Sections 294 and 510 of the IPC:\n\"294.

If one looks at Section 294, the annoyance that is spoken of is clearly defined - that is, it has to be\ncaused by obscene utterances or acts.

We have\nalso seen how there are only two ways in which a blocking order can be passed - one by the\nDesignated Officer after complying with the 2009 Rules and the other by the Designated Officer\nwhen he has to follow an order passed by a competent court. The intermediary applying its own\nmind to whether information should or should not be blocked is noticeably absent in Section 69A\nread with 2009 Rules.\n117.
